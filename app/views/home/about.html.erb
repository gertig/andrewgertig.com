  <p>Hi, I'm Andrew and I've been thinking about people, how we connect with each other and the things we use to try to make us happy, for a very long time.</p>

  <p>You can probably learn a good bit about me by Googling me since I have a unique name, only Andrew Gertig I know of so far. What you may not learn from Google that I do want you to know is that I care about people.</p>\

  <p>
    Other than that one main thing there are plenty of things I love to do, most of all spending time with my wife and kids! As the great philosopher <%= link_to "Robin Scherbatsky", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Scherbatsky" %> once said "Every good relationship has a reacher and a settler." and I can assure you I'm the reacher.

    If you want to read some more you certainly can but I'm warning you it's just fluff from here on.

  <h3>Where I'm from</h3>
  <p>
    I lived in <%= link_to "Kingston, Jamaica", "http://goo.gl/maps/gurBC" %> until I was 16 years old, in fact I have Jamaican heritage that reaches back to the late 1800's.
    My dad is one of the coolest men alive today, he embodies so many of the traits that I seek to emulate as a father and as a man.
    My mom is an amazing woman, a super-carer, a fine-line-walker between letting her children figure things out on their own and being consumed with worry. I don't have very many childhood memories that are missing my mom.
  </p>

  <h3>What got me to now</h3>
  <p>
    While growing up I always had an interest in how the world worked and in particular how humans could build such amazing things. I caught the computer bug in the late eighties which manifested itself in the form of cardboard computers with paper floppy disks. Thankfully my uncle is a geek and he got us a machine running Windows 3.1.1 in '93. How I wish I was cool enough to tell you the processor hertz and what the baud rate of the modem was, but I'm not (losing street cred as a geek quickly).
  </p>

  <p>
    Even though I didn't finish my 9th grade tutoring class in Pascal and I never took my home PC apart to add more RAM I somehow still managed to walk away from college with a degree in Electrical Engineering. During college I worked for the Department of Energy (DoE) at a research lab called <%= link_to "Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL)", "https://www.llnl.gov/" %> on a space based missile defense program, then later I was able to work on tech that was used to <%= link_to "see through the debris [pdf]", "https://e-reports-ext.llnl.gov/pdf/327564.pdf" %> of the World Trade Center after 9/11 to search for heartbeats and breathing. Joining the military right as we invaded Iraq for the second, and hopefully last time, was a surreal experience. I'm proud of my service to my country and feel really lucky to have spent time in the Air Force where I got to do some <%= link_to "crazy cool", "http://www.littlealeinn.com/" %> stuff.
  </p>

  <p>
    During college and the subsequent USAF time as an engineer I discovered that though I could do all the logic, analysis, design, you know the head work of it all, that being an engineer wasn't my passion. I really enjoy people, I love building things, and I sometimes pretend not to but I love teaching.
